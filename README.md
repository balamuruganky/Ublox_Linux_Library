# Ublox_Linux_Library
The aim of this repository to port the SparkFun_u-blox_GNSS_Arduino_Library to linux platform.

## How to pull the code
* git clone https://github.com/balamuruganky/Ublox_Linux_Library
* cd Ublox_Linux_Library
* git submodule update --init

## How to compile Linux (Assumed that CMake setup done already)
* cd linux_build
* mkdir build
* cd build
* cmake ..
* make

## How to compile Android (Assumed that NDK setup done already)
* cd android_build
* ndk-build -j2 NDK_PROJECT_PATH=. APP_BUILD_SCRIPT=./Android.mk NDK_APPLICATION_MK=./Application.mk

## How to execute test
* cd ../bin (Assuming the current directorty is build directory, created above)
* ./ublox_f9p_test /dev/ttyACM0
* ./ublox_f9p_i2c_test /dev/ublox_i2c 0x42 (or without command line arguments)
